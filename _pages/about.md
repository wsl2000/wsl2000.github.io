ðŸ“– Iâ€™m a soon-to-graduate M.Sc. student in Computer Science at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt; I have just finished my thesis and am actively seeking a PhD position.

ðŸ§  My research interests focus on Brain-Computer Interfaces and Human-Computer Interfaces.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently a Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), supervised by Prof. Haizhou Li, and I previously worked with the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology (Chinese Academy of Sciences & CUHK). I have hands-on experience in EEG/sEEG/EMG signal processing, brain-to-text decoding, and large brain models.
