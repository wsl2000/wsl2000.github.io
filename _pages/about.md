I’m a soon-to-graduate M.Sc. student in Computer Science at Technische Universität Darmstadt, just finished my thesis and actively seeking a PhD position. 

🧠My research focuses on Brain-Computer Interfaces and Human-Computer Interfaces.

I’m currently a Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), supervised by Prof. Haizhou Li, and previously worked with the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology (CAS/CUHK-Shenzhen). I bring hands-on experience with EEG/sEEG/EMG signal processing, brain-to-text decoding, and large brain models.
